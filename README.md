# Sunny-Canvas

A JavaScript script that generates a sun moving accross the sky in *real time*

## Synopsis

Sunny-Canvas is a simple HTML canvas that, with the help of JavaScript, generates a sun moving at real time accross a "sky" that changes colour according to the time of day. Currently the default is set to demo time, and so the sun will move at a higher speed. In order to enable the real time movement change `var time = getDemoTime();` to `var time = getRealTime();` on line 43.

## Motivation

The project exists in order to ultimately create a website that houses Sunny-Canvas as a background in the main page (with better colours of course), which will show the sun relatively close to it's actual position in the sky.
