# Sunny-Canvas

A JavaScript script that generates a sun moving accross the sky in *real time*

## Synopsis

Sunny-Canvas is a simple HTML document containing the JavaScript code that generates within an HTML canvas a sun moving at real time (this feature has not yet been completely added) accross a generated sky that changes colour according to the time of day.

## Motivation

The project exists in order to ultimately create a website that houses Sunny-Canvas as a background in the main page, which will show the sun relatively close to it's actual position in the sky.

## Tests

To test it, simply clone or download the repo and open index-sun.html in your browser. Or head over to <a href="https://codepen.io/nickpettican/pen/KadVRP/">Sunny-Canvas</a> at CodePen to see all the code neatly separated.
